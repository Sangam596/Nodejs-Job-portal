# Don't Panic about the error handling and exception
  The package 'express-async-error' will handle the error appropriately. As we all know express sends a function called next into the middleware, which then needs to be called with or without error to make it move the request handling to the next middleware. It still works, but in case of an async function, you don't need to do that.
